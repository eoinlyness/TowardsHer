# Abstract
As more of our personal data is collected by large tech companies, there has been an increasing need for an approach to software development and machine learning that focuses on 
the privacy of the user. We propose a system that using privacypreserving techniques will monitor a userâ€™s daily life and make suggestions in order to improve their life and their
happiness. In addition to keeping sensitive information secure, this contrasts with how personal data is currently being used - primarily for advertising and delivering content - 
ultimately at the benefit of companies rather than the user. In this paper we consider recent approaches to privacy-preserving machine learning and provide an overview of the 
proposed system, first considering a traditional implementation then exploring an approach to transforming this initial system into one which is privacy-preserving. Our experiments 
compare these two approaches and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the system.
